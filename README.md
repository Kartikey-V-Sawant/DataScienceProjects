# Online Data Science and Machine learning Project Submission.
Here i will be uploading all my projects that i have completed in  kaggle competitions.


# 1.Titanic Death and Survival Prediction Machine Learning Model.

In This Project i have used various machine learning models for 
predicting the deaths and survivals of the incident that took place during an voyage.
Here i have used the datasets from kaggle.com.For predictions i have used feature engineering
techniques to get the best features of the datasets.so that we can analyize the data and create 
and best fit model from that data.

# 2. Future Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning Model.
This is second Machine learning project where i have taken an example of dataset from kaggle
which consists of dataset of a sales of each and every product that has been saled with other attributes.
using variou algorithm and analaysis of data we can predict the future sales using this dataset.
