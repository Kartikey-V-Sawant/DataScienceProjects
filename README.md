# Online Data Science and Machine learning Project Submission.
Here i will be uploading all my projects that i have uploaded and participated
in kaggle competitions.


# 1.Titanic Death and Survival Prediction Machine Learning Model.

In This Project i have used various machine learning models for 
predicting the deaths and survivals of the incident that took place during an voyage.
Here i have used the datasets from kaggle.com.For predictions i have used feature engineering
techniques to get the best features of the datasets.so that we can analyize the data and create 
and best fit model from that data.
